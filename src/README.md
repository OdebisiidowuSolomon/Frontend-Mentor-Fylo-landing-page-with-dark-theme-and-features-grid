## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i Was Really Able To Sharpen and Increase My Frontend(Grid, Flexbox, Positioning, Responsive Web Development Etc) and Problem Solving Skills With These Project, it was Quite Handful Especially When Building With Just HTML and CSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
A Piece of Html I Really like Of
<div class="card">
  <div class="text">
    Fylo has improved our team productivity by an order of magnitude. Since
    making the switch our team has become a well-oiled collaboration machine.
  </div>
  <div class="details">
    <img src="images/profile-2.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="name">
      <h5>Bruce McKenzie</h5>
      <p>Founder & CEO, Huddle</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
it Css .card {
  border: 1px solid hsl(219, 30%, 18%);
  background-color: hsl(219, 30%, 18%);
  padding: 2em;
  width: auto;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 1.7em;
  box-shadow: 2px 3px 15px rgb(41, 38, 38);
}
```

### Continued development

i Really Look Forward To Learning

- Scss
- Less
- React And React Native
- And The Mern Stack

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1 How to Use SVG Images in CSS and HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html/)
- This helped me for Understand some details about SVG Images. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2 Selecting Breakpoints - The Options](https://shaydeecoder.hashnode.dev/selecting-breakpoints-the-options) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Breakpoints. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
